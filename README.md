# Helm Charts

The [k8s-at-home](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts/issues/1761) charts repository has been deprecated for a while. Up until now, I could simply update the application image version in the values.yaml file, and no changes had to be made to the chart itself. However, the applications themselves evolve over time, and as a result, the charts also need to be updated.

I will gradually add and maintain all charts that I use myself to this repository.
